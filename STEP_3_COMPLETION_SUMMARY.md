# Step 3 Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Step 3: SharingKey System

### Files Created

1. **`Sources/Core/SharingKeys/BackendQuery.swift`**

   - Core `BackendQuery<Value>` struct with `Sendable`, `Hashable`, and `CustomStringConvertible` conformance
   - Universal SharingKey type for all backend queries
   - Comprehensive static factory methods for all query types:
     - Project queries (allProjectIds, project, projectDetail, buildVersionStrings, etc.)
     - Scheme queries (schemeIds, scheme)
     - Build queries (buildIds, build, latestBuilds, buildLogIds, buildLog)
     - Crash log queries (crashLogIds, crashLog)
   - Domain model convenience extensions for automatic type conversion

2. **`Sources/Core/SharingKeys/BackendQuery+SharingKey.swift`**

   - SharedKey protocol conformance placeholder
   - Will be completed in Step 5 when integrating with backend service
   - BackendQueryError enum for error handling

3. **`Sources/Core/SharingKeys/BackendQueryExtensions.swift`**

   - Type-safe query builder structs (ProjectQueries, SchemeQueries, BuildQueries, etc.)
   - Domain model query builders (DomainProjectQueries, DomainSchemeQueries, etc.)
   - Clean, discoverable API for constructing queries

4. **`Sources/Core/SharingKeys/BackendQueryUsage.swift`**

   - Comprehensive documentation and usage examples
   - Helper functions for advanced query patterns (dependent, parameterized)
   - Query validation utilities (isValid, category, identifier)

5. **`Tests/xcode-builder-2Tests/BackendQueryTests.swift`**
   - Comprehensive Swift Testing test suite with 15 tests
   - Tests for initialization, hashability, and equality
   - Tests for all static factory methods
   - Tests for type-safe query builders
   - Tests for query validation and utility functions

### Key Features Implemented

✅ **Universal BackendQuery<T> Type**

- Single type for all backend queries
- Type-safe with generic Value parameter
- Hashable for efficient caching and comparison
- Proper equality that considers both key and type

✅ **Comprehensive Query Factory Methods**

- 18+ static factory methods covering all domain entities
- Consistent naming convention (entity.operation pattern)
- Support for parameterized queries with optional parameters
- UUID-based and string-based key generation

✅ **Type-Safe Query Builders**

- Discoverable API through structured builder types
- Separate builders for each entity type
- Domain model builders for automatic type conversion
- Default parameter values for common use cases

✅ **Complete Test Coverage**

- 15 comprehensive tests using Swift Testing framework
- Tests for core functionality, factory methods, and builders
- Validation of key generation patterns
- Performance and edge case testing

✅ **Documentation and Examples**

- Comprehensive usage examples for all query types
- Helper functions for advanced patterns
- Query validation utilities
- Inline documentation with practical examples

### Architecture Benefits

1. **Single Universal Key Type**: BackendQuery<T> serves as the universal SharingKey
2. **Type Safety**: Compile-time type checking for all queries
3. **Discoverability**: Structured query builders make API easy to explore
4. **Consistency**: Uniform naming and pattern conventions
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new query types and patterns
6. **Testability**: Comprehensive test suite with focused testing approach

### Build Status

✅ **All targets compile successfully**
✅ **All 15 new tests pass**
✅ **All existing tests continue to pass**
✅ **Clean build with no warnings or errors**

### Next Steps

Step 3 is complete and ready for Step 4 (Local Backend Implementation). The SharedKey protocol conformance will be completed in Step 5 when we integrate with the backend service.

**Time taken**: ~45 minutes (as estimated in planning)
**Test coverage**: Comprehensive with focused testing on essential functionality
**Architecture alignment**: Fully aligned with Step 2 backend abstraction layer
